Now hold up! You don't have to learn the XML format to get games added to GameSave.Info! Just use the Analyzer program included with `MASGAU <http://masgau.org/>`_ to send me a report on a game (it even has a button to automatically e-mail it for you!), and I'll add it for you! But, if you really want to understand how GameSave.Info and MASGAU sources their game data, feel free to read on!
