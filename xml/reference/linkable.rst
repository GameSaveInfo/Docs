<linkable path="Save"/>
Some games can handle having their save folders symlinked to another folder, like inside of a Dropbox or Google Drive folder. Do this on two computers, and you've got their saves automatically synced! The "linkable" element allows you to explain how to link a particular game. This process only works reliably with folders, so that's the only thing you can specify. If you specify a path, it will append that path to any detected locations. If no path, then the detected location itself will be used.
