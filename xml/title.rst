<title>Deus Ex</title>

Between the two title tags you just type up the name of the game. This should be the name that was first attached to a game when it was release, other names would be delegated to version titles, which we will talk about later. Try to include the entire name, no reason to skimp on length. It might be tempting to shorten Penny Arcade Adventures: On The Rain Slick Precipice Of Darkness Chapter One to Penny Arcade Adventures 1, but resist it.
